🎉 **I'm excited to launch Low·sai — an AI-powered memory palace platform that's now open-source!**

What if you could combine an ancient memory technique used by Roman orators with cutting-edge AI? That's exactly what Low·sai does.

**The Ancient Technique:**
The method of loci (memory palace) has been used for thousands of years to memorize vast amounts of information by associating concepts with visual locations in a familiar space.

**The Modern Twist:**
Low·sai uses AI image generation to create vivid, memorable visuals for anything you want to learn — from historical dates to scientific concepts to language vocabulary.

**What I Built:**
✨ Interactive memory palace creation with custom room layouts
🎨 AI-generated imagery using Stability AI
💾 Save and manage multiple memory palaces
🔐 Secure authentication with demo mode
📱 Fully responsive design
♿ WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliant

**Why Open Source:**
I believe learning tools should be accessible to everyone. That's why I'm releasing Low·sai under the Apache 2.0 license. Whether you're a student, educator, or developer, you can use, modify, and contribute to make memory techniques more accessible.

**Try it out:**
🌐 Live site: https://low-sai.com
💻 GitHub: https://github.com/aaronipollock/memory-palace
📚 Full documentation in the repo

**Tech Stack:**
React.js • Node.js • MongoDB • Stability AI • Tailwind CSS

I'd love to hear your thoughts! Have you used memory palaces before? What would you memorize first?
