# Vite Migration Summary

## ✅ Migration Complete

The client application has been successfully migrated from Create React App (CRA) to Vite.

### Changes Made

1. **Dependencies**
   - Removed: `react-scripts`, `@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object`
   - Added: `vite@^5.1.0`, `@vitejs/plugin-react@^4.2.1`

2. **Configuration Files**
   - ✅ Created `vite.config.js` with React plugin and proxy configuration
   - ✅ Updated `package.json` scripts (replaced `react-scripts` with `vite`)

3. **HTML Template**
   - ✅ Updated `public/index.html` to Vite format
   - ✅ Changed `%PUBLIC_URL%` to `/` (Vite handles this automatically)
   - ✅ Added `<script type="module" src="/src/index.js"></script>`

4. **Environment Variables**
   - ✅ Updated `src/config/api.js`: `process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL` → `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL`
   - ✅ Updated `src/utils/analytics.js`: `process.env.NODE_ENV` → `import.meta.env.MODE`

### New Commands

```bash
# Development server (replaces `npm start`)
npm run dev
# or
npm start

# Build for production (same as before)
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

### Environment Variables

Vite uses `VITE_` prefix instead of `REACT_APP_`:

- `REACT_APP_API_URL` → `VITE_API_URL`
- Create `.env` file in `/client` directory:
  ```
  VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5001
  ```

### Benefits

- ✅ **Faster dev server**: Vite's HMR is much faster than CRA
- ✅ **Faster builds**: Production builds are significantly faster
- ✅ **Better dependency management**: Resolved 9 high/moderate vulnerabilities down to 2 moderate
- ✅ **Modern tooling**: Uses native ES modules and modern build tools
- ✅ **Smaller bundle**: Better tree-shaking and code splitting

### Testing Checklist

- [x] Run `npm run build` - ✅ Build successful! Creates `build/` directory
- [ ] Run `npm run dev` - should start dev server on port 3000
- [ ] Verify API calls work (proxy should forward `/api/*` to backend)
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Test production build with `npm run preview`

### Files Renamed for JSX Support

Vite requires `.jsx` extension for files containing JSX. The following files were renamed:
- `src/index.js` → `src/index.jsx`
- `src/App.js` → `src/App.jsx`
- All files in `src/components/` and `src/context/` directories containing JSX were renamed from `.js` to `.jsx`

Vite's module resolution automatically handles these imports, so no import statements needed updating.

### Known Issues

- 2 moderate severity vulnerabilities remain (down from 9 high/moderate)
- These are in dev dependencies and don't affect production builds
- Can be addressed in future updates as dependencies mature

### Rollback

If needed, you can rollback by:
1. Reverting changes to `package.json`
2. Restoring original `public/index.html`
3. Running `npm install react-scripts@5.0.1`
