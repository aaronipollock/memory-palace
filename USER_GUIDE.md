## Introduction

Welcome to Memory Palace, an AI-powered application that helps you create and use the ancient method of loci (pronounced *low-sai*) to improve your memory. This technique uses spatial memory and visual associations to make information more memorable.

### What is a Memory Palace?

A memory palace is a mental technique where you associate information you want to remember with specific locations in a familiar place (like a room). By creating vivid, memorable images for each piece of information and placing them at distinct locations, you can recall the information by mentally "walking through" the space.

Bread
Eggs

Coffee
Pasta
```

**Tips for Better Memorables:**
- Be specific and concrete
- Use nouns rather than abstract concepts
- Keep items related to a single theme or category

### Step 4: Generate Your Memory Palace
